# MythOS v1 security model

## Defaults

- Debian's signed shim, GRUB, and kernel packages provide the Secure Boot path.
- Calamares offers full-disk encryption and keeps the recovery partition
  unencrypted so it can boot independently.
- UFW denies unsolicited inbound traffic and allows outbound traffic.
- AppArmor is enabled at boot.
- SSH and Snap are disabled and absent unless a user explicitly enables them.
- Diagnostics are disabled. v1 contains no background telemetry uploader.
- Camera, microphone, screencast, and location access for sandboxed apps flow
  through the desktop portals and GNOME permission surfaces.
- System Hub mutations use a narrowly identified Polkit executable and require
  administrator authentication. Its command handlers validate enumerated
  actions, feature identifiers, snapshot numbers, and device paths.

## Update trust and rollback

APT sources use Debian's archive keyring. Stable and Current both retain the
Debian stable base. Update state, errors, and the bounded transaction history
are mode `0600` under `/var/lib/mythos`.

Updates are downloaded before restart and installed by systemd's offline-update
mechanism. The updater refuses its transactional path unless root is Btrfs and
the `@`, `@snapshots`, and persistent `@state` layout plus Snapper root
configuration are operational. It creates a restore point before changing
packages. On failure, an initramfs pre-mount helper validates the numeric
snapshot and restricted transaction identifier, preserves the failed root, and
recreates `@` from the requested snapshot before mounting the operating system.

## Application and migration boundaries

Flatpak applications use system remotes and portals. A Windows executable is
never launched directly by the compatibility UI: it is delegated to Bottles,
which owns the per-application Wine environment. Compatibility entries without
evidence stay `untested`; a filename match is not promoted to a working claim.

The Windows migration assistant never deletes the source, never follows source
symlinks, and never overwrites a destination. Conflicts receive a visible
`(from Windows)` suffix. Windows-protected browser passwords are explicitly
excluded because copying encrypted databases would create a misleading and
unsafe promise.

AppImage import requires an ELF/AppImage header, copies the file to a
user-controlled directory, and escapes desktop-entry command characters. It
still executes publisher-supplied native code and therefore presents a trust
warning; AppImage is not described as sandboxed.

## Recovery safety

Bootloader repair accepts only explicit `/dev/...` targets, verifies the root
filesystem type, mounts it in a private temporary path, and checks the
MythOS marker before invoking GRUB. Desktop reset backs up GNOME settings
before resetting only the desktop-related key prefixes. Keep-files reset and
destructive reinstall remain installer/recovery operations and must show their
target disk before execution.

## Release threats still requiring operational controls

- Public images need a real HTTPS project origin, an incident contact, a
  signed release manifest, and a decided source/binary license.
- Every release needs fresh boot validation on Secure Boot hardware, an
  encrypted install, suspend/resume, update failure injection, recovery boot,
  and representative Intel/AMD/NVIDIA and Wi-Fi hardware.
- Flathub application IDs and Debian package availability must be checked at
  release time. Third-party runtime behavior can change independently.
- A compatibility report is advisory; vendor anti-cheat and DRM policy can
  change without an operating-system update.
